/**
 * A CRML period literal to a {@code CRMLtoModelica.Types.CRMLPeriod} component
 * and its {@code CRMLPeriod_build} companion.
 *
 * <p>One CRML class covers two Modelica targets. A literal whose boundaries are
 * clocks - "Periods P is [ c1, c2 ]" - is a {@code CRMLPeriods}, whose
 * {@code start_event} and {@code close_event} are {@code Types.CRMLClock}; a
 * literal whose boundaries are events - "Period P is [ e1, e2 ]" - is a
 * {@code CRMLPeriod}, whose two boundary fields are {@code Types.Event}. Which
 * one is decided from the boundary values' types.
 *
 * <p>The string generator's {@code PeriodsGen} was dead code and wrong in three
 * ways; none of them is reproduced here:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>it named the component from {@code periods.hashCode()}, which makes the
 *     output non-deterministic. The name now comes from the context's
 *     allocator, which is scoped per class and counts from one.
 * <li>it concatenated the type name and the variable name with no separator,
 *     producing {@code CRMLtoModelica.Types.CRMLPeriodp12345(}. The component is
 *     now an object-model node, so the printer decides the spacing.
 * <li>it named the modifier {@code start=}, but the field in
 *     {@code CRMLtoModelica.mo} is {@code start_event} - and it passed a Boolean
 *     expression where {@code start_event} and {@code close_event} are of type
 *     {@code Types.Event}, so each boundary condition is wrapped in an Event
 *     construction first.
 * </ul>
